This project is developed for self-learning prurposes. This project has been developed using Python, and it's libraries (pyttsx3, speech_recognition, wikipedia, and datetime, etc). It is a simple project to assist a desktop. I have added some basic functionalities (such as, show time, send email, open Google, open youtube, play music, etc) which is taken by command using the library ##speech_recognition.
